A simple tool to lint the complexity of docstrings.

# Usage

`doclint <file>` to analyse the complexity of the docstrings within that file. Warning if mildly complex, error if complex.

# Roadmap

- Better reporting so you can find the function easily.
- Support linting multiple files at once.
- Arguments for ARI complexity thresholds.
- Support pyproject.toml configuration.
- Make GA extension.
- Improve documentation.
- Parse different kinds of Python docstrings to lint relevant parts.
- Not just Python files, lint markdown too.
- Support different formulas of complexity.
